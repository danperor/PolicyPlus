# Compiling Policy Plus
You can acquire the Policy Plus source code by cloning with [Git](https://git-scm.com/):

    git clone https://github.com/Fleex255/PolicyPlus.git
	
It is recommended to set Git to ignore local changes to the autogenerated version file:

    git update-index --assume-unchanged PolicyPlus\Version.vb
	
You can run `version.bat` at any time to replace that file with one that specifies your current commit.

Policy Plus is developed with [Visual Studio 2019 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/). (Fancier Visual Studio editions will work too.)

To compile, open `PolicyPlus.sln` or `PolicyPlus.vbproj` (from the `PolicyPlus` folder) in Visual Studio. Set the *Solution Configurations* dropdown to Release (or Debug for a debug build).
Choose *Build* | *Build PolicyPlus* from the main menu. The result is `PolicyPlus.exe`, which is set to run on 32-bit or 64-bit environments, preferring to run in a 64-bit process.
You can find that file in the subfolder of `bin` that corresponds to the build type.
